            Matariki is a star cluster that appears in the early morning sky in New Zealand during the mid-winter months. According to the maramataka the reappearance of Matariki brings the old lunar
            year to a close and marks the beginning of the new year. Hence, Matariki is associated with the Maori New Year.

          <p>
            The Matariki star cluster, consists of 9 stars and it is well known throughout the world and at different times of the year can be seen around the globe. It is one of the brightest
            clusters in the sky, containing hundreds of member stars. Matariki has different names around the world. In English, it is called by its ancient Greek name, Pleiades or the Seven Sisters.
            In Hawaiian it is Makali’i, “eyes of royalty”, and in Japan it is called Subaru, meaning “gathered together
          </p>
          <p>
            The exact calendar date of Matariki actually varies each year because it is based on lunar cycles, and different iwi begin their Matariki festivities at different times. Normally the
            matariki cluster is visible in Aotearoa skies in Hunae or Hurae ranei.
